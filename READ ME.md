To the Core - LowRezJam 2019

This repository contains all the data of the game 'To the Core', a two-week project for LowRezJam 2019. All the code, images 
and sounds in here may be used as inspirations for your own projects, either because they show up a relevant solution for an 
issue, or a mistake you should avoid.

The game itself IS NOT AVAIABLE FOR REDISTRIBUTION. You can not claim this game to be your own, and any intent to reuse the 
art assets, or to update the game, must be informed to the owners of this repository.
Any other use than this is completely free, even for comercial projects. 

TLDR: Copy the code that's relevant for your project; levae the art resources alone; don't copy the game design.

You can access the game at: https://motherserpent.itch.io/to-the-core
